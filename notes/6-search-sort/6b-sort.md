## Selection sort

- [Selection sort slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ui3k6JgZW3bjJENYwvFS_8jRzdx2WK9rtK6_4oLJBr4/edit?usp=sharing)
- This site has nice interactive examples: https://visualgo.net/en/sorting
- Exercise: https://onecompiler.com/cpp/43daktmy5
- Exercise: add a Boolean `descending` parameter to the sort function to control the order of the sort.
- Practice: perform a selection sort of each list below (by hand) showing the state of the list after each pass.
  - `{ 90, 43, 1, 93, 13, 43, 84, 12 }`
  - `{ 24, 35, 72, 47, 68, 11, 21, 99 }`
  - `{ 50, 82, 23, 7, 55, 67, 18, 2 }`

## Insertion sort

- [Insertion sort slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1idofHqkyUqHRQhA4v79gr2YIhP11km0cVd7Rf5rpTPU/edit?usp=sharing)
- This site has nice interactive examples: https://visualgo.net/en/sorting
- Exercise: https://onecompiler.com/cpp/43dak4srz
- Exercise: add a Boolean `descending` parameter to the sort function to control the order of the sort.
- Practice: perform an insertion sort of each list below (by hand) showing the state of the list after each pass.
  - `{ 90, 43, 1, 93, 13, 43, 84, 12 }`
  - `{ 24, 35, 72, 47, 68, 11, 21, 99 }`
  - `{ 50, 82, 23, 7, 55, 67, 18, 2 }`

## Radix sort

- [Radix sort slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qh4fpgI3JcBGSHbtR6S3Rrbpx7TuOEPzS8rIZmzVZqA/edit?usp=sharing)
- This site has nice interactive examples: https://visualgo.net/en/sorting
- Exercise: https://onecompiler.com/cpp/43davfhyw
- Practice: perform an insertion sort of each list below (by hand) showing the state of the list after each pass.
  - `{ 90, 43, 1, 93, 13, 43, 84, 12 }`
  - `{ 24, 35, 72, 47, 68, 11, 21, 99 }`
  - `{ 50, 82, 23, 7, 55, 67, 18, 2 }`

## Study guide

- Be able to perform selection, insertion, and radix sorts manually and be able to identify the state of an array after some number of passes of a sort have been applied.
  - For example: given the array `{ 98, 12, 40, 23, 24, 90, 12, 38 }`, what would the array look like after three passes of selection sort?
- Understand the runtime complexity of selection and insertion sorts.
- Be able to read and write code that performs insertion, selection, and radix sorts.
