# Development Environment

Programming assignments in this course support GitHub Codespaces. This allows you to work in an online, browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. This supports a wide range of devices (Windows, Mac, Chromebook, iPad, etc.).

If you want to install the development tools locally on your computer, you are free (and encouraged) to do so. Instructions are provided for Windows and Mac.

- [Windows using Visual Studio Code](./windows-vscode.md)
- [macOS using Visual Studio Code](./mac-vscode.md)

Other development environments/editors can be used, but no support is provided.
