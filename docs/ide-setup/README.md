# Development Environment

## GitHub Codespaces

Programming assignments in this course support GitHub Codespaces. This allows you to work in an online, browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. This supports a wide range of devices (Windows, Mac, Chromebook, iPad, etc.).

- [Instructions for Codespaces](./codespace.md)

**This is the recommended way of completing assignments in this course.**

## Local Development

If you want to install the development tools locally on your computer, you are free to do so. Instructions are provided for Windows and Mac.

- [Windows using Visual Studio Code](./windows-vscode.md)
- [macOS using Visual Studio Code](./mac-vscode.md)

Other development environments/editors can be used, but no support is provided.

## Dev Containers

You can use the same development environment that Codespace uses, but run it locally on your computer using Docker.

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- Clone your assignment repository to your computer.
- Open your local repository in VS Code.
- Use the **Reopen in Container** option in VS Code.
